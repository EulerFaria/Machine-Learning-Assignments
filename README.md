# Machine-Learning-Assignments

This repository was created to share my solutions for the 04 assignments done through the course of [Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/teaching/index.html) in my master's degree. All the problems presenteded on this class had some requirements and restrictions regarding strategies and techiniques that imposed sometimes a pre-defined methodology to be followed. All of those points are discussed on the reports.

For each task there is a jupyter notebook containing the solution developed and a writen report explaining step by step of how the results were achivied as well as the dificulties/limitations found on each problem. You can find those reports on the following links:

  - [Assignment 01](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dhjmpdgyzthw);
  - [Assignment 02](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cswhwjsbpmqh);
  - Assignment 03;
  - Assignment 04;
