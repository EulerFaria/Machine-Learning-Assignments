# Machine-Learning-Assignments

This repository was created to share my solutions for the 04 assignments done through the course of Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition in master's degree. All the problems presenteded on this class had some requirements and restrictions regarding strategies and techiniques that imposed a pre-defined methodology to be followed. All of those points are discussed on the reports.

For each task there is a jupyter notebook containing the solution developed and a writen report explaining step by step of how the results were achivied as well as the dificulties/limitations found on each problem. You can find those reports on the following links:

  - [Assignment 01](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dhjmpdgyzthw);
  - Assignment 02;
  - Assignment 03;
  - Assignment 04;
